  "description": "Technical publications documenting Cognitive-Local Language Models (C-LLMs), adaptive cognitive architectures, evaluation frameworks, and system implementations. This repository contains technical reports (TR-Series), benchmark evaluations, architectural whitepapers, and supporting documentation for Aurora, the first production C-LLM system. All publications follow Thynaptic Research House Style Guide and document evidence-grounded cognitive architectures operating independently of model inference.",
