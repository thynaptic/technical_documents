# Thynaptic Research: Zenodo Publication Repository

---

## Overview

This repository structures all Thynaptic Research publications for archival and distribution through Zenodo. We organize research outputs by category: technical reports, benchmark evaluations, architectural whitepapers, and supporting diagrams. All publications follow Thynaptic Research House Style Guide and maintain consistency in metadata, formatting, and citation standards.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the following publication categories:

- **TR-Reports:** Technical research reports documenting cognitive architectures, system components, and evaluation frameworks
- **Benchmarks:** Benchmark evaluation reports and framework documentation
- **Whitepapers:** Comprehensive architectural whitepapers and system overviews
- **Diagrams:** Visual documentation and architectural diagrams
- **METADATA:** Zenodo integration metadata and configuration files

## Publication Categories

### TR-Reports

Technical research reports (TR-2025-##) document cognitive architectures, system components, evaluation frameworks, and comparative analyses. These reports follow the Thynaptic Technical Framework Report template, providing architectural context, methodology, evaluation results, system behavior analysis, limitations, and forward research trajectories.

### Benchmarks

Benchmark evaluation reports document performance assessments, evaluation frameworks, and cognitive capability measurements. Reports include Cognitive MMLU (C-MMLU) framework documentation, benchmark results, and evaluation methodology specifications.

### Whitepapers

Comprehensive architectural whitepapers provide system-level overviews, architectural foundations, and integration specifications. Whitepapers document complete cognitive architectures, routing systems, and adaptive layer implementations.

### Diagrams

Visual documentation including architectural diagrams, component maps, pipeline visualizations, and system flow charts. Diagrams support technical reports and whitepapers by providing visual representations of cognitive architectures and system components.
