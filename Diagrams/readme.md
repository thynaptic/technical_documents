## Overview

This folder contains visual documentation including architectural diagrams, component maps, pipeline visualizations, and system flow charts. Diagrams support technical reports and whitepapers by providing visual representations of cognitive architectures, system components, and data flow.

---

## Diagram Categories

### Architectural Diagrams

Visual representations of system architecture, component relationships, and integration points. Diagrams document cognitive pipeline stages, routing maps, and system boundaries.

### Component Maps

Detailed visualizations of individual components, their interfaces, data flow, and integration with other system components. Maps document component architecture, input/output specifications, and interaction patterns.

### Pipeline Visualizations

Flow charts and process diagrams documenting cognitive processing pipelines, routing logic, fallback paths, and reasoning activation sequences. Visualizations show sequential component processing and decision points.

### System Flow Charts

High-level system flow documentation showing end-to-end processing, from user input through cognitive pipeline to model inference and response generation. Flow charts document complete system operation.

## Diagram Standards

All diagrams in this folder follow:

- **Consistent Visual Language:** Standardized notation for components, data flow, and system boundaries
- **Technical Accuracy:** Diagrams accurately represent architectural implementation and component relationships
- **Supporting Documentation:** Diagrams complement technical reports and whitepapers with visual context
- **Export Formats:** Diagrams available in multiple formats for publication and integration

---

## File Formats

Diagrams are provided in standard formats:

- **SVG:** Scalable vector graphics for web and print publication
- **PNG:** Raster images for documentation and presentations
- **PDF:** Vector graphics for academic publication

---

## Integration

Diagrams integrate with:

- Technical reports through cross-references
- Whitepapers as supporting visual documentation
- GitHub repository documentation
- Zenodo publication archives

---

## Report Status

This folder is prepared for future diagram additions. As visual documentation is created to support technical reports and whitepapers, diagrams will be added here for publication and archival.
